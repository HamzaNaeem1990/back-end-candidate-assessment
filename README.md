# candidate-assessment
A web development task to demonstrate technical thought process and development approach.

### Web developer task

Given a JSON collection of 9 cars, we'd like you to create a simple ASP.NET MVC web application that lists the car information supplied.

The application should initially list 3 cars, with a load more button to dynamically retrieve a further 3 cars at a time.
The data can be passed in as simple in-memory objects.

Consideration over techniques for sorting and filtering the data along with unit tests would be very useful.

Please include a read me file in your project describing how to interact with your application along with the significance of any automated tests you may have added to your solution.
